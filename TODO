    * The client should not send the server iv1; the server should 
        decide on its own.  Likewise for iv2.  This affects
        all implementations (Go, C, etc)

    * OAEP salt is confusion from Go, where apparently either a         * YEP
        function (rand) or a byte slice can be passed through the       * YEP

        - that is, an int parameter to a function gets handled as       * DONE
            such, so that we can create a random 32-bit value, pass     * DONE
            it to clientEncryptHello, and successfully test it, without * DONE
            having to cast it                                           * DONE

    * github is trashing links to images in README.md by inserting
        'blob/master/' between xlreg_py/ and img/.  Same problem 
        occurs on all README images, at least those in the xlreg_*
        group.
