    * make sure that a plain int can be construed as a DecimalVersion
        - that is, an int parameter to a function gets handled as 
            such, so that we can create a random 32-bit value, pass
            it to clientEncryptHello, and successfully test it, without
            having to cast it
    * test clientEncryptHello() by itself
    * test the clientEncryptHello / serverDecryptHello as a pair, 
        making sure that the server sees what the client sent
    * similary test serverEncryptReply / clientDecryptReply

    * converted to Python 3, but problems using binascii.b2ab_hex(),
        so using dumpByteArray() instead: FIX ME

    * github is trashing links to images in README.md by inserting
        'blob/master/' between xlreg_py/ and img/.  Same problem 
        occurs on all README images, at least those in the xlreg_*
        group.

            * possibly can use ECB instead of NONE, but latter preferred
        - PyCrypto PKCS_OAEP
        - Ruby rsa-oaep-mgf1p, possibly:
        http://informationcard.rubyforge.org/svn/gem/tags/0.1.0/lib/information_card/decrypter.rb
    * consider OpenSSL gold standard, put test values in a public place
        - private 2048-bit RSA key
        - public part
        - value to be encrypted 
        - expected encrypted value
